                <h2> SEE THE PIAZZA DEL PLEBISCITO</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn2.civitatis.com/italia/napoles/guia/plaza-del-plebiscito.jpg" alt="">
                <p>All of your Naples sightseeing starts here in the Piazzo del Plebiscito. It’s a beautiful pedestrian
                    square with views of the Basilica Royal and the Royal Palace
                    The Piazzo del Plebiscito is open all hours of the day and is the perfect place to really get to
                    know the spirit of Naples.</p>

                <h2> DISCOVER THE RUINS OF POMPEII</h2>
                <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/picture-famous-pompeii-mount-vesuvius-set-against-vibrant-sunset-pompeii-mount-vesuvius-against-vibrant-183889713.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>Pompeii, the city that was frozen in time in the wake of Vesuvius’ eruption, is one of the most
                    famous sites around Naples and has so much to offer its visitors. Explore the remarkably well
                    preserved and restored large theatre, where if you stand center stage and speak everyone in the
                    seats can hear you. Visit the brothel that is famous for its unique, lewd paintings positioned above
                    each doorway detailing what went on inside. Pompeii is famous for the preserved remains of people
                    trying to escape the volcanic eruption, now frozen forever in a thick coat of ash.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>3. VISIT THE SAN GENNARO CATACOMBS</h2>
                <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/catacombs-san-gennaro-1552279773-735X412.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>If you’re looking for something to do in Naples itself, visit the San Gennaro Catacombs. Hidden just
                    100 steps beneath the city, the catacombs are home to over 3000 burial sites, including that of San
                    Gennaro, the celebrated patron of Naples.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>4. EXPLORE HERCULANEUM</h2>
                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTMSKLLN9h9BIdbSFT1Dq131ch7El52LXohHw&usqp=CAU"
                    alt="">
                <p>Herculaneum is another town that was smothered by the volcanic ash of Mount Vesuvius’ eruption and
                    offers an even more culturally enriching and much less touristy experience, with more
                    tourist-friendly signage to help you understand what you’re seeing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>5. VISIT CASTEL NUOVO</h2>
                <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/castel-nuovo-1552280067-735X412.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>Castel Nuovo is a distinctive piece of the Naples’ skyline and an essential part of any Naples
                    sightseeing. The castle features an intricate marble central façade surrounded by thick brick towers
                    and fortifications. There’s a museum inside where you can see an incredible collection of
                    sculptures, frescoes, and paintings from the 14th to the 19th centuries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>6. CLIMB MOUNT VESUVIUS</h2>
                <img src="https://www.pompeiitours.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-is-the-history-of-Mount-Vesuvius-e1553475535460.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>Perhaps the most famous piece of Naples’ skyline is Mount Vesuvius, a volcano that has proved itself
                    as deadly as it is picturesque. Mount Vesuvius is famous for its eruption in 79 AD that resulted in
                    the destruction of both Pompeii and Herculaneum. It’s still considered one of the most dangerous
                    volcanoes in Europe.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>7. EXPLORE CAPRI ISLAND</h2>
                <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/capri-island-1552282287-735X412.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>If you want to get off the mainland, consider hopping on a ferry and taking the hour-long ride to the
                    stunning island of Capri. Surrounded by the startlingly blue waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea and
                    characterized by craggy hills covered in trees, Capri island will capture your heart so you may
                    never want to leave!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>8. TRY PIZZA IN ITS BIRTHPLACE</h2>
                <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/pizza-italy-1552282753-735X412.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>If you’re ever at a loss about what to do in Naples, take a deep breath and then go get some pizza.
                    Really! Naples is known as the birthplace of pizza and it’s impossible to get a bad pizza anywhere
                    in the city. When it comes to this famous dish, Neapolitans really know what they’re doing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>9. VISIT THE ROYAL PALACE OF NAPLES</h2>
                <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/royal-palace-of-naples-1552283427-735X412.jpg"
                    alt="">
                <p>The Royal Palace of Naples or the Palazzo Reale is one of the most underrated attractions Naples has
                    to offer. While the outside of the palace looks like something from a Wes Anderson film, the
                    interior is full of massive rooms decorated in lavish colors with paintings, chandeliers and
                    gold-leafed furniture.</p>

                <h2>10. CHECK OUT THE NAPLES NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM</h2>
                <img src="https://luxinfolio.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/atlas.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The Naples National Archeological Museum is one of the largest archeological museums in the world and
                    is famous for its Roman collections, as well as for one of the largest Egyptian collections in
                    Europe. Many of the best frescoes and mosaics from nearby Pompeii and Herculaneum are now located in
                    this museum, making it a natural addition to any trip that includes exploring the history of this
                    region.</p>
